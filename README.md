Resource Allocation and Deadlock Detection Simulator
- Overview -
The Resource Allocation and Deadlock Detection Simulator is a Python application designed to simulate a system where multiple processes share a fixed number of resources. It helps users understand how deadlocks occur, implement basic resource allocation systems, and detect deadlocks using a simple detection algorithm.

Problem Statement:
In systems with shared resources, processes often contend for limited resources, potentially leading to deadlockâ€”a state where no process can proceed because they are waiting for resources held by others. This simulator models such scenarios, demonstrates resource allocation, and helps detect deadlocks in a controlled environment.

Intended Audience:
Students: Learn about resource allocation and deadlock concepts in Operating Systems.
Educators: Use as a teaching aid for demonstrating resource contention and deadlock detection.
Software Engineers: Experiment with resource allocation logic and algorithms.

Features
Process Simulation:

Simulate multiple processes with maximum demand, current allocation, and pending requests.
Resource Management:

Manage multiple resource types with total and available units.
Allocate resources dynamically based on requests.
Deadlock Detection:

Implements a basic detection algorithm to identify circular waiting among processes.
Provides detailed insights into deadlock scenarios.
Step-by-Step Simulation:

Observe how each process requests and releases resources.
Detect deadlocks after each allocation or release operation.

Running the Simulator:
Open the resource_allocation_simulator.py file in your Python IDE.
Run the file.
Observe the step-by-step simulation output in the terminal.
